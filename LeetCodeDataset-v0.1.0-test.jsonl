This allows us to only consider the most recent updates for each row and column.\n- We use `row_updated` and `col_updated` sets to keep track of which rows and columns have been updated.\n- We use `row_values` and `col_values` lists to store the values that have been set for each row and column, although these are not strictly necessary for the sum calculation.\n- For each row update, we add the contribution of that row to the total sum, which is the value times the number of columns that haven't been updated yet.\n- Similarly, for each column update, we add the contribution of that column to the total sum, which is the value times the number of rows that haven't been updated yet.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the sum without explicitly constructing and modifying a large matrix.", "input_output": [{"input": "n = 3, queries = [[0,0,1],[1,2,2],[0,2,3],[1,0,4]]", "output": "23"}, {"input": "n = 3, queries = [[0,0,4],[0,1,2],[1,0,1],[0,2,3],[1,2,1]]", "output": "17"}], "meta": {"question_id": 2838, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given an integer n and a 0-indexed 2D array queries where queries[i] = [typei, indexi, vali].\nInitially, there is a 0-indexed n x n matrix filled with 0's.

The idea is to preprocess the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` to create a structure that allows us to quickly answer the queries. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Sort the Arrays**: First, we sort the pairs `(nums1[i], nums2[i])` in descending order based on `nums1`. If `nums1` values are the same, we sort by `nums2` in descending order. This helps in efficiently finding the maximum sum for a given `xi` and `yi`.\n\n2. **Monotonic Stack**: We use a monotonic stack to maintain a sequence of pairs `(nums1[j], nums2[j])` such that for any two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` in the stack, if `a >= c`, then `b <= d`. This ensures that for any query, we can efficiently find the maximum possible sum `nums1[j] + nums2[j]`.\n\n3. **Process Queries**: For each query, we iterate through the sorted list of pairs and use the monotonic stack to find the maximum sum that satisfies the constraints.\n\nHere's the complete code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSumQueries(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        # Combine nums1 and nums2 into pairs and sort them in descending order of nums1\n        pairs = sorted(zip(nums1, nums2), reverse=True)\n        \n        # Sort queries and keep track of the original indices\n        sorted_queries = sorted(enumerate(queries), key=lambda x: (-x[1][0], -x[1][1]))\n        \n        # Result array initialized with -1\n        result = [-1] * len(queries)\n        \n        # Monotonic deque to maintain pairs (nums1[j], nums2[j] + nums1[j])\n        dq = deque()\n        \n        # Index to iterate over pairs\n        pair_index = 0\n        \n        # Process each query\n        for query_index, (xi, yi) in sorted_queries:\n            # Add pairs to the deque that satisfy nums1[j] >= xi\n            while pair_index < len(pairs) and pairs[pair_index][0] >= xi:\n                xj, yj = pairs[pair_index]\n                sum_j = xj + yj\n                \n                # Maintain the deque to be monotonic\n                while dq and dq[-1][1] <= sum_j:\n                    dq.pop()\n                \n                # Add the current pair to the deque\n                dq.append((yj, sum_j))\n                pair_index += 1\n            \n            # Find the maximum sum that satisfies nums2[j] >= yi\n            while dq and dq[0][0] < yi:\n                dq.popleft()\n            \n            # If the deque is not empty, the front element has the maximum sum\n            if dq:\n                result[query_index] = dq[0][1]\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: We sort the pairs in descending order of `nums1` to ensure that we can efficiently process queries for larger `xi` values first.\n- **Monotonic Deque**: The deque maintains a sequence of pairs `(yj, sum_j)` where `sum_j = nums1[j] + nums2[j]`. The deque is monotonic in the sense that for any two pairs `(y1, sum1)` and `(y2, sum2)` in the deque, if `y1 >= y2`, then `sum1 <= sum2`.\n- **Query Processing**: For each query, we add pairs to the deque that satisfy `nums1[j] >= xi` and maintain the monotonic property of the deque. We then remove pairs from the front of the deque that do not satisfy `nums2[j] >= yi`. The front of the deque at this point will have the maximum sum for the query.\n\nThis approach ensures that each query is processed efficiently, and the overall complexity is manageable given the constraints.", "input_output": [{"input": "nums1 = [4,3,1,2], nums2 = [2,4,9,5], queries = [[4,1],[1,3],[2,5]]", "output": "[6,10,7]"}, {"input": "nums1 = [3,2,5], nums2 = [2,3,4], queries = [[4,4],[3,2],[1,1]]", "output": "[9,9,9]"}, {"input": "nums1 = [2,1], nums2 = [2,3], queries = [[3,3]]", "output": "[-1]"}], "meta": {"question_id": 2839, "difficulty": "Hard", "question_title": "You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, each of length n, and a 1-indexed 2D array queries where queries[i] = [xi, yi].\nFor the ith query, find the maximum value of nums1[j] + nums2[j] among all indices j (0 <= j < n), where nums1[j] >= xi and nums2[j] >= yi, or -1 if there is no j satisfying the constraints.\nReturn an array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums1 = [4,3,1,2], nums2 = [2,4,9,5], queries = [[4,1],[1,3],[2,5]]\nOutput: [6,10,7]\nExplanation: \nFor the 1st query xi = 4 and yi = 1, we can select index j = 0 since nums1[j] >= 4 and nums2[j] >= 1.

The bitmask `mask` is an integer where the `i`-th bit is `1` if `nums[i]` is included in the permutation, and `0` otherwise.\n\n2. **Recursive Function with Memoization**: We define a recursive function `dp(mask, last)` that returns the number of valid permutations starting from the current state (represented by `mask`) and ending with `nums[last]`. We use `lru_cache` to memoize the results and avoid redundant calculations.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If `mask` is `(1 << n) - 1`, it means all numbers have been included in the permutation, so we return `1` as a valid permutation has been found.\n\n4. **Recursive Case**: For each number `nums[i]` that has not been included in the permutation (i.e., `(mask & (1 << i)) == 0`), we check if it can be the next number in the permutation by verifying the divisibility condition with `nums[last]`. If it can, we recursively call `dp` with the updated mask and the new last index.\n\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take the result modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to prevent overflow.\n\n6. **Initial Call**: We start the recursion with an empty mask (`0`) and `-1` as the initial last index (indicating no numbers have been included yet).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible permutations while keeping track of the valid ones using dynamic programming and bit masking.", "input_output": [{"input": "nums = [2,3,6]", "output": "2"}, {"input": "nums = [1,4,3]", "output": "2"}], "meta": {"question_id": 2848, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing n distinct positive integers.

We can achieve this by checking all permutations of the strings and merging them optimally.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumString(self, a: str, b: str, c: str) -> str:\n        def merge(x: str, y: str) -> str:\n            # Find the longest suffix of x that is a prefix of y\n            for i in range(len(x)):\n                if y.startswith(x[i:]):\n                    return x + y[len(x) - i:]\n            return x + y\n        \n        def contains_all(s: str, a: str, b: str, c: str) -> bool:\n            return a in s and b in s and c in s\n        \n        # Generate all permutations of the strings a, b, c\n        perms = permutations([a, b, c])\n        \n        min_str = None\n        for p in perms:\n            # Merge the first two strings\n            merged1 = merge(p[0], p[1])\n            # Merge the result with the third string\n            merged2 = merge(merged1, p[2])\n            \n            # Check if the merged string contains all three strings\n            if contains_all(merged2, a, b, c):\n                if min_str is None or len(merged2) < len(min_str) or (len(merged2) == len(min_str) and merged2 < min_str):\n                    min_str = merged2\n        \n        return min_str\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Merge Function**: The `merge` function takes two strings `x` and `y` and finds the longest suffix of `x` that is a prefix of `y`.

This helps in efficiently finding overlapping intervals.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of overlapping intervals.\n   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the sorted array.\n   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to the right as long as the interval `[nums[left] - k, nums[right] + k]` is valid (i.e., `nums[right] + k >= nums[left] - k`).\n   - Once the interval becomes invalid, move the `left` pointer to the right to make it valid again.\n   - Keep track of the maximum length of the window during this process.\n\nHere's the complete code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        nums.sort()\n        left = 0\n        max_beauty = 0\n        \n        for right in range(len(nums)):\n            while nums[right] - k > nums[left] + k:\n                left += 1\n            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, right - left + 1)\n        \n        return max_beauty\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: We sort the array to easily find overlapping intervals.\n- **Sliding Window**: We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of overlapping intervals.\n- **Condition Check**: For each `right` pointer, we check if the current interval `[nums[left] - k, nums[right] + k]` is valid. If not, we move the `left` pointer to the right to make it valid.\n- **Update Maximum Beauty**: We update the maximum beauty as the length of the current valid window.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest subsequence of equal elements after applying the allowed operations, with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\) due to sorting and \\(O(n)\\) for the sliding window traversal, making it suitable for large input sizes.", "input_output": [{"input": "nums = [4,6,1,2], k = 2", "output": "3"}, {"input": "nums = [1,1,1,1], k = 10", "output": "4"}], "meta": {"question_id": 2891, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a 0-indexed array nums and a non-negative integer k.\nIn one operation, you can do the following:\n\nChoose an index i that hasn't been chosen before from the range [0, nums.length - 1].\nReplace nums[i] with any integer from the range [nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k].\n\nThe beauty of the array is the length of the longest subsequence consisting of equal elements.\nReturn the maximum possible beauty of the array nums after applying the operation any number of times.\nNote that you can apply the operation to each index only once.\nA subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [4,6,1,2], k = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: In this example, we apply the following operations:\n- Choose index 1, replace it with 4 (from range [4,8]), nums = [4,4,1,2].\n- Choose index 3, replace it with 4 (from range [0,4]), nums = [4,4,1,4].\nAfter the applied operations, the beauty of the array nums is 3 (subsequence consisting of indices 0, 1, and 3).\nIt can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible length we can achieve.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,1], k = 10\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: In this example we don't have to apply any operations.\nThe beauty of the array nums is 4 (whole array).\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 105\n0 <= nums[i], k <= 105\n\n", "lang_code": "class Solution:\n    def maximumBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:"}}

The final result will be the maximum of `even_score` and `odd_score`.\n\nHere's the complete code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxScore(self, nums: List[int], x: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize scores for even and odd endings\n        even_score = float('-inf')\n        odd_score = float('-inf')\n        \n        # Set the initial score based on the parity of nums[0]\n        if nums[0] % 2 == 0:\n            even_score = nums[0]\n        else:\n            odd_score = nums[0]\n        \n        # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] % 2 == 0:\n                # Update even_score\n                even_score = max(even_score + nums[i], odd_score + nums[i] - x)\n            else:\n                # Update odd_score\n                odd_score = max(odd_score + nums[i], even_score + nums[i] - x)\n        \n        # The result is the maximum of the two scores\n        return max(even_score, odd_score)\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the maximum score by considering the parity of each number and updating the scores accordingly.

This allows us to consider the most profitable items first.\n\n2. **Use a Set for Categories**: Use a set to keep track of the distinct categories we have included in our current subsequence of size `k`.\n\n3. **Track Duplicates**: We need to handle items with duplicate categories. We can use a list to store the profits of items that have duplicate categories so that we can later swap them with items that introduce a new category.\n\n4. **Greedy Selection**: Start by selecting the top `k` items based on profit. Track the total profit and the distinct categories. If we encounter an item with a duplicate category, add its profit to the list of duplicate profits.\n\n5. **Maximize Elegance**: If the number of distinct categories is less than `k`, we can try to swap items with duplicate categories for items that introduce a new category.

For a given safeness factor `k`, we will check if there exists a path from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, n-1)` such that every cell in the path has a distance to the nearest thief of at least `k`.\n   - For this, we can use a BFS to traverse the grid and check if we can reach the destination while maintaining the required safeness factor.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumSafenessFactor(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        n = len(grid)\n        dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        queue = deque()\n        \n        # Initialize the queue with all thief positions\n        for r in range(n):\n            for c in range(n):\n                if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                    queue.append((r, c))\n                    dist[r][c] = 0\n        \n        # BFS to compute the shortest distance to the nearest thief\n        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n        while queue:\n            r, c = queue.popleft()\n            for dr, dc in directions:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and dist[nr][nc] == float('inf'):\n                    dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1\n                    queue.append((nr, nc))\n        \n        # Binary search for the maximum safeness factor\n        def can_reach_with_safeness(k):\n            if dist[0][0] < k:\n                return False\n            visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n            queue = deque([(0, 0)])\n            visited[0][0] = True\n            while queue:\n                r, c = queue.popleft()\n                if r == n - 1 and c == n - 1:\n                    return True\n                for dr, dc in directions:\n                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                    if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n and not visited[nr][nc] and dist[nr][nc] >= k:\n                        visited[nr][nc] = True\n                        queue.append((nr, nc))\n            return False\n        \n        low, high = 0, n * 2  # The maximum possible safeness factor is at most the size of the grid\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high + 1) // 2\n            if can_reach_with_safeness(mid):\n                low = mid\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        \n        return low\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **BFS for Distance Calculation**: We use BFS to calculate the shortest distance from each cell to the nearest thief. This is done by starting BFS from all thief positions simultaneously.\n- **Binary Search**: We perform a binary search on the possible safeness factors. For each mid-value, we check if it's possible to reach from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, n-1)` while maintaining at least `mid` distance from any thief using another BFS.\n- **Complexity**: The BFS for distance calculation runs in `O(n^2)`, and the binary search with BFS for each mid-value also runs in `O(n^2)`, making the overall complexity `O(n^2 log n)`.", "input_output": [{"input": "grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]", "output": "0"}, {"input": "grid = [[0,0,1],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]", "output": "2"}, {"input": "grid = [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]]", "output": "2"}], "meta": {"question_id": 2914, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a 0-indexed 2D matrix grid of size n x n, where (r, c) represents:\n\nA cell containing a thief if grid[r][c] = 1\nAn empty cell if grid[r][c] = 0\n\nYou are initially positioned at cell (0, 0).

Namely, it's just the new index of s[0].\nHow to find the integer(s) that can represent string t?\nCreate a new string s + t + t (length = 3 * n).\nUse Z-algorithm (or KMP), for each n <= index < 2 * n, calculate the maximum prefix length that each substring starts from index can match, if the length >= n, then (index - n) is a valid integer representation.\nHow to get the result?\nIt's a very obvious DP.\nIf we use an integer to represent a string, we only need to consider the transition from zero to non-zero and from non-zero to zero. In other words, all the non-zero strings should have the same result.\nSo let dp[t][i = 0/1] be the number of ways to get the zero/nonzero string\nafter excatly t steps.\nThen\ndp[t][0] = dp[t - 1][1] * (n - 1).\nAll the non zero strings can make it.\ndp[t][1] = dp[t - 1][0] + dp[t - 1] * (n - 2).\nFor a particular non zero string, all the other non zero strings and zero string can make it.\nWe have dp[0][0] = 1 and dp[0][1] = 0\nUse matrix multiplication.\nHow to calculate dp[k][x = 0, 1] faster?\nUse matrix multiplication\nvector (dp[t - 1][0], dp[t - 1][1])\nmultiplies matrix\n[0 1]\n[n - 1 n - 2]\n== vector (dp[t][0], dp[t - 1][1]).\nSo we just need to calculate the kth power of the matrix which can be done by fast power algorith.\nComplexity\nTime complexity:\nO(n + logk)\nSpace complexity:\nO(n)\n\"\"\"\n\n\nclass Solution:\n    M: int = 1000000007\n\n    def add(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n        x += y\n        if x >= self.M:\n            x -= self.M\n        return x\n\n    def mul(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:\n        return int(x * y % self.M)\n\n    def getZ(self, s: str) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(s)\n        z = [0] * n\n        left = right = 0\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if i <= right and z[i - left] <= right - i:\n                z[i] = z[i - left]\n            else:\n                z_i = max(0, right - i + 1)\n                while i + z_i < n and s[i + z_i] == s[z_i]:\n                    z_i += 1\n                z[i] = z_i\n            if i + z[i] - 1 > right:\n                left = i\n                right = i + z[i] - 1\n        return z\n\n    def matrixMultiply(self, a: List[List[int]], b: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:\n        m = len(a)\n        n = len(a[0])\n        p = len(b[0])\n        r = [[0] * p for _ in range(m)]\n        for i in range(m):\n            for j in range(p):\n                for k in range(n):\n                    r[i][j] = self.add(r[i][j], self.mul(a[i][k], b[k][j]))\n        return r\n\n    def matrixPower(self, a: List[List[int]], y: int) -> List[List[int]]:\n        n = len(a)\n        r = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]\n        for i in range(n):\n            r[i][i] = 1\n        x = [a[i][:] for i in range(n)]\n        while y > 0:\n            if y & 1:\n                r = self.matrixMultiply(r, x)\n            x = self.matrixMultiply(x, x)\n            y >>= 1\n        return r\n\n    def numberOfWays(self, s: str, t: str, k: int) -> int:\n        n = len(s)\n        dp = self.matrixPower([[0, 1], [n - 1, n - 2]], k)[0]\n        s += t + t\n        z = self.getZ(s)\n        m = n + n\n        result = 0\n        for i in range(n, m):\n            if z[i] >= n:\n                result = self.add(result, dp[0] if i - n == 0 else dp[1])\n        return result\n", "entry_point": "Solution().numberOfWays", "test": "def check(candidate):\n    assert candidate(s = \"abcd\", t = \"cdab\", k = 2) == 2\n    assert candidate(s = \"ababab\", t = \"ababab\", k = 1) == 2\n", "query": "You are given two strings s and t of equal length n.

For a string of length `n`, there are `n-1` possible non-trivial rotations (excluding the rotation that results in the original string).\n\n2. **Check for Valid Rotations**: For each rotation of `s`, check if it matches `t`. If it does, then that rotation is a valid target for our transformation.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We can use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach the target string `t` in exactly `k` operations. We'll maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to reach the `j`-th rotation of `s` in `i` operations.\n\n4. **Transition**: For each state `dp[i][j]`, we can transition to any other state `dp[i+1][k]` if the `k`-th rotation is a valid rotation that can be reached from the `j`-th rotation in one operation.\n\n5. **Base Case**: Initially, `dp[0][0] = 1` because there's one way to be at the original string with 0 operations.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we'll take results modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfWays(self, s: str, t: str, k: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        n = len(s)\n        \n        # Check if t is a rotation of s\n        if t not in (s + s):\n            return 0\n        \n        # Find all rotations of s that match t\n        valid_rotations = [i for i in range(1, n) if s[i:] + s[:i] == t]\n        \n        # If there are no valid rotations, return 0\n        if not valid_rotations:\n            return 0\n        \n        # dp[i][j] = number of ways to reach rotation j in i operations\n        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]\n        \n        # Base case: dp[0][0] = 1 (0 operations to reach the original string)\n        dp[0][0] = 1\n        \n        # Fill the dp table\n        for i in range(k):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if dp[i][j] == 0:\n                    continue\n                # Try all possible rotations\n                for l in range(1, n):\n                    next_rotation = (j + l) % n\n                    dp[i + 1][next_rotation] = (dp[i + 1][next_rotation] + dp[i][j]) % MOD\n        \n        # Sum up the ways to reach any valid rotation in k operations\n        result = sum(dp[k][j] for j in valid_rotations) % MOD\n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently counts the number of ways to transform `s` into `t` using exactly `k` operations by leveraging dynamic programming and considering all possible rotations.", "input_output": [{"input": "s = \"abcd\", t = \"cdab\", k = 2", "output": "2"}, {"input": "s = \"ababab\", t = \"ababab\", k = 1", "output": "2"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3024, "difficulty": "Hard", "question_title": "You are given two strings s and t of equal length n.

If it is not, it means adding `current` will not violate the constraint, so we add it to the set and add its value to `total_sum`.\n\n- **Increment `current`**: We increment `current` by 1 to consider the next positive integer.\n\n- **Return the Sum**: Finally, we return the sum of the array modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we construct the array with the minimum possible sum while satisfying the given constraints.", "input_output": [{"input": "n = 2, target = 3", "output": "4"}, {"input": "n = 3, target = 3", "output": "8"}, {"input": "n = 1, target = 1", "output": "1"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3026, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given positive integers n and target.\nAn array nums is beautiful if it meets the following conditions:\n\nnums.length == n.\nnums consists of pairwise distinct positive integers.\nThere doesn't exist two distinct indices, i and j, in the range [0, n - 1], such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target.\n\nReturn the minimum possible sum that a beautiful array could have modulo 109 + 7.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2, target = 3\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We can see that nums = [1,3] is beautiful.\n- The array nums has length n = 2.\n- The array nums consists of pairwise distinct positive integers.\n- There doesn't exist two distinct indices, i and j, with nums[i] + nums[j] == 3.\nIt can be proven that 4 is the minimum possible sum that a beautiful array could have.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, target = 3\nOutput: 8\nExplanation: We can see that nums = [1,3,4] is beautiful.\n- The array nums has length n = 3.\n- The array nums consists of pairwise distinct positive integers.\n- There doesn't exist two distinct indices, i and j, with nums[i] + nums[j] == 3.\nIt can be proven that 8 is the minimum possible sum that a beautiful array could have.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: n = 1, target = 1\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: We can see, that nums = [1] is beautiful.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 109\n1 <= target <= 109\n\n", "lang_code": "class Solution:\n    def minimumPossibleSum(self, n: int, target: int) -> int:"}}

Each key in the dictionary represents a node, and the corresponding value is a list of its neighbors.\n  \n- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function calculates the sum of values for the subtree rooted at the current node. It starts with the value of the current node and recursively adds the values of its children (excluding the parent to avoid cycles).\n\n- **Counting Valid Components**: After calculating the sum of values for a subtree, we check if it is divisible by `k`. If it is, we increment the `valid_components` counter and return `0` to reset the sum for further calculations. Otherwise, we return the total sum of the subtree.\n\n- **Starting DFS**: We start the DFS from node `0` (or any node, since the tree is connected). The parent of the starting node is set to `-1` to indicate that there is no parent.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the maximum number of valid components in the tree.", "input_output": [{"input": "n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k = 6", "output": "2"}, {"input": "n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [3,0,6,1,5,2,1], k = 3", "output": "3"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3058, "difficulty": "Hard", "question_title": "There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.

Therefore, to minimize the sum of the scores of the subarrays, we should try to create subarrays where the AND operation results in the smallest possible values.\n\nThe smallest possible value for the AND operation is `0`. If we can find subarrays where the AND of all elements in the subarray is `0`, we should do so. This is because `0` will not increase the sum of scores, and it allows us to maximize the number of subarrays.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Calculate the bitwise AND of the entire array. If this value is `0`, then it means we can potentially split the array into multiple subarrays where each subarray's AND is `0`.\n2. If the bitwise AND of the entire array is not `0`, then the minimum sum of scores we can achieve is the AND of the entire array, and we can only have one subarray.\n3. To find the maximum number of subarrays with an AND of `0`, we can iterate through the array and keep a running AND.

If no triplets are available, it's impossible, so return -1.\n- **Summing Operations**: We accumulate the operations needed for each unique element and return the total.", "input_output": [{"input": "nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]", "output": "4"}, {"input": "nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]", "output": "-1"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3094, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.\nThere are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:\n\nChoose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\nChoose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:\n- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3.

We will iterate through each number in `nums` and update our DP array accordingly.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lengthOfLongestSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize a DP array with -1, where dp[t] will store the length of the longest subsequence with sum t\n        dp = [-1] * (target + 1)\n        # Base case: a sum of 0 can be achieved with an empty subsequence\n        dp[0] = 0\n        \n        # Iterate over each number in nums\n        for num in nums:\n            # We iterate backwards to avoid using the same number multiple times\n            for t in range(target, num - 1, -1):\n                if dp[t - num] != -1:\n                    dp[t] = max(dp[t], dp[t - num] + 1)\n        \n        # The answer is the length of the longest subsequence that sums up to target\n        return dp[target]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize a DP array `dp` of size `target + 1` with `-1`. This array will store the length of the longest subsequence that sums up to each value from `0` to `target`.\n   - We set `dp[0]` to `0` because a sum of `0` can always be achieved with an empty subsequence.\n\n2. **DP Transition**:\n   - For each number `num` in `nums`, we update the DP array from `target` down to `num`. This ensures that we do not reuse the same number multiple times in the same subsequence.\n   - For each possible sum `t` from `target` down to `num`, if `dp[t - num]` is not `-1` (meaning a subsequence with sum `t - num` exists), we update `dp[t]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[t - num] + 1`.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - After processing all numbers, `dp[target]` will contain the length of the longest subsequence that sums up to `target`. If no such subsequence exists, `dp[target]` will remain `-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest subsequence with the desired sum using dynamic programming.", "input_output": [{"input": "nums = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 9", "output": "3"}, {"input": "nums = [4,1,3,2,1,5], target = 7", "output": "4"}, {"input": "nums = [1,1,5,4,5], target = 3", "output": "-1"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3106, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums, and an integer target.\nReturn the length of the longest subsequence of nums that sums up to target.

However, we need to keep track of which item from which shop it is.\n\n2. **Sort the Items**: We sort all items by their value in non-decreasing order. This allows us to buy the least expensive item each day, which is optimal because the price of an item is multiplied by the day number, and later days have higher multipliers.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Spending**: We iterate over the sorted list of items, buying each item on the next available day and accumulating the total cost.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSpending(self, values: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        # Flatten the list of values with their respective days\n        items = []\n        for i, shop in enumerate(values):\n            for j, value in enumerate(shop):\n                items.append((value, i, j))\n        \n        # Sort items by their value in non-decreasing order\n        items.sort()\n        \n        total_spending = 0\n        day = 1\n        \n        # Buy items in the order of their sorted values\n        for value, i, j in items:\n            total_spending += value * day\n            day += 1\n        \n        return total_spending\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Flattening and Tracking**: We create a list of tuples where each tuple contains the value of an item, the shop index, and the item index within that shop.

Additionally, each element in `heights` must be less than or equal to the corresponding element in `maxHeights`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Identify the Peak Position**: We need to determine the peak position `i` in the mountain array.

This can be done using depth-first search (DFS) with memoization to avoid recalculating results for nodes that have already been processed.\n\n4. **Calculate Results**: Using the information from the previous steps, calculate the number of unique nodes visited for each starting node.\n\nHere's the complete implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countVisitedNodes(self, edges: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(edges)\n        visited = [False] * n\n        in_cycle = [False] * n\n        cycle_length = [0] * n\n        result = [0] * n\n        \n        def dfs(node, dist_from_start, dist_from_cycle, stack):\n            if visited[node]:\n                if node in stack:\n                    cycle_start = stack.index(node)\n                    cycle_size = len(stack) - cycle_start\n                    for i in range(cycle_start, len(stack)):\n                        in_cycle[stack[i]] = True\n                        cycle_length[stack[i]] = cycle_size\n                return\n            visited[node] = True\n            stack.append(node)\n            dfs(edges[node], dist_from_start + 1, dist_from_cycle + 1, stack)\n            stack.pop()\n        \n        # Step 1: Identify cycles and their lengths\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                dfs(i, 0, 0, [])\n        \n        # Step 2: Calculate the number of unique nodes visited for each node\n        for i in range(n):\n            if result[i] == 0:  # Only calculate if not already done\n                current = i\n                nodes_visited = 0\n                while not in_cycle[current]:\n                    nodes_visited += 1\n                    current = edges[current]\n                # Now current is in a cycle\n                result[i] = nodes_visited + cycle_length[current]\n                # Fill in the result for all nodes in the same path to the cycle\n                next_node = i\n                while next_node != current:\n                    result[next_node] = result[current] + nodes_visited\n                    nodes_visited -= 1\n                    next_node = edges[next_node]\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function is used to traverse the graph and identify cycles. It keeps track of the distance from the start node and the distance from the cycle. If a node is revisited and is part of the current stack, it identifies a cycle.\n\n- **Cycle Identification**: After the DFS traversal, nodes that are part of a cycle are marked in `in_cycle`, and their cycle lengths are stored in `cycle_length`.\n\n- **Result Calculation**: For each node, if it is not part of a cycle, we traverse to the cycle and count the number of nodes visited until we reach the cycle. The result for nodes in the same path to the cycle is then filled in using the cycle length.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the number of unique nodes visited for each starting node in the graph.", "input_output": [{"input": "edges = [1,2,0,0]", "output": "[3,3,3,4]"}, {"input": "edges = [1,2,3,4,0]", "output": "[5,5,5,5,5]"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3140, "difficulty": "Hard", "question_title": "There is a directed graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n directed edges.\nYou are given a 0-indexed array edges where edges[i] indicates that there is an edge from node i to node edges[i].\nConsider the following process on the graph:\n\nYou start from a node x and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this same process.\n\nReturn an array answer where answer[i] is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node i.\n \nExample 1:\n\n\nInput: edges = [1,2,0,0]\nOutput: [3,3,3,4]\nExplanation: We perform the process starting from each node in the following way:\n- Starting from node 0, we visit the nodes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0.

The key observation here is that the bitwise OR operation will set a bit to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1, while the bitwise AND operation will set a bit to 1 only if both corresponding bits of the operands are 1.\n\nGiven this operation, we can deduce that the operation will eventually concentrate the 1-bits from all numbers into a few numbers. Specifically, after performing the operation sufficiently many times, we can end up with numbers that have fewer 1-bits, but these 1-bits will be distributed in a way that maximizes the sum of squares of `k` numbers.\n\nThe strategy is to count the number of 1-bits at each bit position across all numbers.

We should iterate over all possible bit positions, not just the most common ones. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        MOD = 10**9 + 7\n        \n        # Count the number of 1-bits at each bit position\n        bit_count = Counter()\n        max_bit_position = 0\n        for num in nums:\n            bit_position = 0\n            while num > 0:\n                if num & 1:\n                    bit_count[bit_position] += 1\n                    max_bit_position = max(max_bit_position, bit_position)\n                num >>= 1\n                bit_position += 1\n        \n        # Construct the k largest numbers\n        max_sum = 0\n        for _ in range(k):\n            current_number = 0\n            for bit_position in range(max_bit_position + 1):\n                if bit_count[bit_position] > 0:\n                    current_number |= (1 << bit_position)\n                    bit_count[bit_position] -= 1\n            max_sum = (max_sum + current_number * current_number) % MOD\n        \n        return max_sum\n```\n\nThis code correctly counts the number of 1-bits at each bit position and constructs the `k` largest numbers by distributing the 1-bits optimally.

The minimum cost for a subtree rooted at a node `u` is the minimum of:\n   - The value of node `u` itself (if we set it to zero, we need to ensure the rest of the subtree is healthy).\n   - The sum of the minimum costs of all its children (if we keep the value of node `u` and make sure each child subtree is healthy).\n4. **Calculate Maximum Score**: The maximum score is the total sum of all node values minus the minimum cost to make the entire tree healthy.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumScoreAfterOperations(self, edges: List[List[int]], values: List[int]) -> int:\n        from collections import defaultdict\n        \n        # Build the adjacency list for the tree\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        for u, v in edges:\n            graph[u].append(v)\n            graph[v].append(u)\n        \n        def dfs(u, parent):\n            # Base case: if the node is a leaf, the minimum cost to keep it healthy is its value\n            if len(graph[u]) == 1 and u != 0:\n                return values[u]\n            \n            # Calculate the sum of minimum costs for all children\n            min_cost = 0\n            for v in graph[u]:\n                if v != parent:\n                    min_cost += dfs(v, u)\n            \n            # The minimum cost to keep the subtree rooted at u healthy\n            return min(values[u], min_cost)\n        \n        # Calculate the total sum of all node values\n        total_sum = sum(values)\n        \n        # Calculate the minimum cost to make the tree healthy\n        min_cost_to_keep_healthy = dfs(0, -1)\n        \n        # The maximum score is the total sum minus the minimum cost to keep the tree healthy\n        return total_sum - min_cost_to_keep_healthy\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Graph Construction**: We use an adjacency list to represent the tree.\n- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function calculates the minimum cost to make the subtree rooted at a given node healthy. It recursively calculates the cost for each child and returns the minimum of the node's value or the sum of the costs of its children.\n- **Total Sum and Minimum Cost**: We calculate the total sum of all node values and subtract the minimum cost to keep the tree healthy to get the maximum score.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the score while keeping the tree healthy according to the given constraints.", "input_output": [{"input": "edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]", "output": "11"}, {"input": "edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]", "output": "40"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3191, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted at node 0.

We'll maintain a dictionary to store the last positions of each balance value.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def beautifulSubstrings(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        vowels = set('aeiou')\n        n = len(s)\n        balance = 0\n        balance_count = {0: [-1]}  # To handle the case when the substring starts from index 0\n        beautiful_count = 0\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            if s[i] in vowels:\n                balance += 1\n            else:\n                balance -= 1\n            \n            # Check if this balance has been seen before\n            if balance in balance_count:\n                for prev_index in balance_count[balance]:\n                    # Number of vowels and consonants in the substring s[prev_index+1:i+1]\n                    count = i - prev_index\n                    if (count // 2) ** 2 % k == 0:\n                        beautiful_count += 1\n                balance_count[balance].append(i)\n            else:\n                balance_count[balance] = [i]\n        \n        return beautiful_count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Vowel Set**: We use a set `vowels` to quickly check if a character is a vowel.\n- **Balance**: We maintain a `balance` variable that increments for vowels and decrements for consonants.\n- **Balance Count**: We use a dictionary `balance_count` to store the indices where each balance value has been seen. This helps in finding substrings with equal numbers of vowels and consonants.\n- **Beautiful Count**: For each balance value, we check all previous indices where this balance was seen. If the substring formed between these indices has a length such that the square of half the length is divisible by `k`, we count it as a beautiful substring.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of beautiful substrings in linear time relative to the length of the string.", "input_output": [{"input": "s = \"baeyh\", k = 2", "output": "2"}, {"input": "s = \"abba\", k = 1", "output": "3"}, {"input": "s = \"bcdf\", k = 1", "output": "0"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3210, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a string s and a positive integer k.\nLet vowels and consonants be the number of vowels and consonants in a string.\nA string is beautiful if:\n\nvowels == consonants.\n(vowels * consonants) % k == 0, in other terms the multiplication of vowels and consonants is divisible by k.\n\nReturn the number of non-empty beautiful substrings in the given string s.\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.\nVowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.\nConsonant letters in English are every letter except vowels.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"baeyh\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: There are 2 beautiful substrings in the given string.\n- Substring \"baeyh\", vowels = 2 ([\"a\",e\"]), consonants = 2 ([\"y\",\"h\"]).\nYou can see that string \"aeyh\" is beautiful as vowels == consonants and vowels * consonants % k == 0.\n- Substring \"baeyh\", vowels = 2 ([\"a\",e\"]), consonants = 2 ([\"b\",\"y\"]). \nYou can see that string \"baey\" is beautiful as vowels == consonants and vowels * consonants % k == 0.\nIt can be shown that there are only 2 beautiful substrings in the given string.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abba\", k = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: There are 3 beautiful substrings in the given string.\n- Substring \"abba\", vowels = 1 ([\"a\"]), consonants = 1 ([\"b\"]). \n- Substring \"abba\", vowels = 1 ([\"a\"]), consonants = 1 ([\"b\"]).\n- Substring \"abba\", vowels = 2 ([\"a\",\"a\"]), consonants = 2 ([\"b\",\"b\"]).\nIt can be shown that there are only 3 beautiful substrings in the given string.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"bcdf\", k = 1\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: There are no beautiful substrings in the given string.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 1000\n1 <= k <= 1000\ns consists of only English lowercase letters.\n\n", "lang_code": "class Solution:\n    def beautifulSubstrings(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:"}}

The idea is to maintain a window that contains the maximum element at least `k` times and then count all subarrays that can be formed from this window.\n\n3. **Expand and Contract the Window**:\n   - Expand the window by moving the right end (`right`) and count how many times the maximum element appears.\n   - Once the maximum element appears at least `k` times, contract the window from the left end (`left`) and count the subarrays that can be formed.\n\n4. **Count Subarrays**: For each valid position of the right end of the window, count the number of valid subarrays that can be formed by moving the left end.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        max_element = max(nums)\n        n = len(nums)\n        count = 0\n        left = 0\n        max_count = 0\n        \n        for right in range(n):\n            if nums[right] == max_element:\n                max_count += 1\n            \n            while max_count >= k:\n                count += n - right  # All subarrays starting from left to right are valid\n                if nums[left] == max_element:\n                    max_count -= 1\n                left += 1\n        \n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **max_element**: This stores the maximum value in the array.\n- **count**: This keeps track of the number of valid subarrays.\n- **left**: This is the left boundary of the sliding window.\n- **max_count**: This counts how many times the maximum element appears in the current window.\n\n### How the Loop Works:\n- For each position `right`, we increment `max_count` if `nums[right]` is the maximum element.\n- If `max_count` is at least `k`, it means the current window `[left, right]` is valid.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a good choice here because it can efficiently compute all-pairs shortest paths in a graph.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: For each subset, use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of remaining branches and check if all distances are within the allowed `maxDistance`.\n\n4. **Count Valid Subsets**: Count the number of subsets that satisfy the distance condition.\n\nHere's the complete code implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nclass Solution:\n    def numberOfSets(self, n: int, maxDistance: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        def floyd_warshall(graph, nodes):\n            dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]\n            for u in nodes:\n                dist[u][u] = 0\n            for u, v, w in roads:\n                if u in nodes and v in nodes:\n                    dist[u][v] = min(dist[u][v], w)\n                    dist[v][u] = min(dist[v][u], w)\n            \n            for k in nodes:\n                for i in nodes:\n                    for j in nodes:\n                        dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])\n            \n            return dist\n        \n        def is_valid_subset(nodes):\n            if not nodes:\n                return True\n            dist = floyd_warshall(roads, nodes)\n            for u in nodes:\n                for v in nodes:\n                    if dist[u][v] > maxDistance:\n                        return False\n            return True\n        \n        count = 0\n        for r in range(n + 1):\n            for subset in combinations(range(n), r):\n                if is_valid_subset(subset):\n                    count += 1\n        \n        return count\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: This function computes the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the given subset.

For each subset, we check if it is valid using the `is_valid_subset` function and count it if it is.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of \\(O(2^n \\cdot n^3)\\) due to the combination generation and the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

The goal is to achieve the lexicographically smallest possible array.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Group Elements by Connectivity**: We need to group elements that can be swapped with each other. This can be done using a graph-based approach where each element is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if the absolute difference between the corresponding elements is less than or equal to `limit`.\n\n2. **Sort Each Group**: Once we have the groups, we can sort each group to get the smallest possible elements at the front.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Array**: Finally, we reconstruct the array by placing the smallest elements from each group in their respective positions.\n\nHere's the implementation of the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nclass Solution:\n    def lexicographicallySmallestArray(self, nums: List[int], limit: int) -> List[int]:\n        n = len(nums)\n        # Create a graph where each node is an index and edges exist between nodes if their values can be swapped\n        graph = defaultdict(list)\n        \n        # Create a sorted list of (value, index) pairs\n        indexed_nums = sorted((num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums))\n        \n        # Build the graph\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            if indexed_nums[i][0] - indexed_nums[i-1][0] <= limit:\n                graph[indexed_nums[i-1][1]].append(indexed_nums[i][1])\n                graph[indexed_nums[i][1]].append(indexed_nums[i-1][1])\n        \n        # Function to perform BFS and find all connected components\n        def bfs(start):\n            queue = deque([start])\n            component = []\n            visited[start] = True\n            while queue:\n                node = queue.popleft()\n                component.append(node)\n                for neighbor in graph[node]:\n                    if not visited[neighbor]:\n                        visited[neighbor] = True\n                        queue.append(neighbor)\n            return component\n        \n        # Find all connected components\n        visited = [False] * n\n        components = []\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                components.append(bfs(i))\n        \n        # Sort each component and place the sorted values back into their positions\n        result = nums[:]\n        for component in components:\n            # Get the values in the component and sort them\n            values = sorted(nums[i] for i in component)\n            # Place the sorted values back into their original positions\n            for val, idx in zip(values, sorted(component)):\n                result[idx] = val\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Graph Construction**: We build a graph where each node represents an index in the array, and edges exist between nodes if the absolute difference between the corresponding elements is within the `limit`.\n- **BFS for Connected Components**: We use BFS to find all connected components in the graph.

There can be up to three nearest palindromic numbers: the largest palindromic number less than or equal to the median, the smallest palindromic number greater than or equal to the median, and the nearest palindromic number that is not the median itself (if it exists).\n\n3. **Calculate Costs**: Calculate the total cost for each of these palindromic numbers and return the minimum cost.\n\n4. **Helper Function to Check Palindrome**: Implement a helper function to check if a number is a palindrome.\n\nHere's the complete code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        def is_palindrome(x: int) -> bool:\n            s = str(x)\n            return s == s[::-1]\n        \n        def find_nearest_palindromes(x: int):\n            # Find the largest palindromic number <= x\n            low = x\n            while not is_palindrome(low):\n                low -= 1\n            \n            # Find the smallest palindromic number >= x\n            high = x\n            while not is_palindrome(high):\n                high += 1\n            \n            return low, high\n        \n        # Step 1: Find the median of the array\n        nums.sort()\n        n = len(nums)\n        median = nums[n // 2] if n % 2 == 1 else (nums[n // 2 - 1] + nums[n // 2]) // 2\n        \n        # Step 2: Find the nearest palindromic numbers to the median\n        low, high = find_nearest_palindromes(median)\n        \n        # Step 3: Calculate the cost for each nearest palindromic number\n        def calculate_cost(target: int) -> int:\n            return sum(abs(num - target) for num in nums)\n        \n        cost_low = calculate_cost(low)\n        cost_high = calculate_cost(high)\n        \n        # Step 4: Return the minimum cost\n        return min(cost_low, cost_high)\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.minimumCost([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Example input\n```\n\nThis code first finds the median of the array, then determines the nearest palindromic numbers to this median, and finally calculates the cost for each of these palindromic numbers, returning the minimum cost.", "input_output": [{"input": "nums = [1,2,3,4,5]", "output": "6"}, {"input": "nums = [10,12,13,14,15]", "output": "11"}, {"input": "nums = [22,33,22,33,22]", "output": "22"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3229, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums having length n.\nYou are allowed to perform a special move any number of times (including zero) on nums.

If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\nOutput: 28\nExplanation: To convert the string \"abcd\" to string \"acbe\":\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: source = \"aaaa\", target = \"bbbb\", original = [\"a\",\"c\"], changed = [\"c\",\"b\"], cost = [1,2]\nOutput: 12\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: source = \"abcd\", target = \"abce\", original = [\"a\"], changed = [\"e\"], cost = [10000]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= source.length == target.length <= 105\nsource, target consist of lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000\noriginal[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.\n1 <= cost[i] <= 106\noriginal[i] != changed[i]\n\n", "lang_code": "class Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, source: str, target: str, original: List[str], changed: List[str], cost: List[int]) -> int:"}}

Store these indices in another list.\n\n3. **Check for beautiful indices:** For each index `i` in the list of indices where `a` is found, check if there exists an index `j` in the list of indices where `b` is found such that `|i - j| <= k`.\n\n4. **Return the list of beautiful indices:** Collect all such indices `i` that satisfy the condition and return them in sorted order.\n\nHere is the implementation of the above plan:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def beautifulIndices(self, s: str, a: str, b: str, k: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Find all starting indices of substring a in s\n        indices_a = [i for i in range(len(s) - len(a) + 1) if s[i:i + len(a)] == a]\n        \n        # Find all starting indices of substring b in s\n        indices_b = [i for i in range(len(s) - len(b) + 1) if s[i:i + len(b)] == b]\n        \n        beautiful_indices = []\n        \n        # Check for beautiful indices\n        for i in indices_a:\n            for j in indices_b:\n                if abs(i - j) <= k:\n                    beautiful_indices.append(i)\n                    break  # No need to check further for this i\n        \n        return sorted(beautiful_indices)\n\n# Example usage:\n# sol = Solution()\n# print(sol.beautifulIndices(\"abacadabab\", \"ab\", \"cad\", 2))  # Example output\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Finding indices:** We use list comprehensions to find all starting indices of `a` and `b` in `s`.\n- **Checking for beautiful indices:** For each index `i` in `indices_a`, we iterate through `indices_b` to find a `j` such that `|i - j| <= k`. If such a `j` is found, we add `i` to the list of beautiful indices and break out of the inner loop to avoid unnecessary checks.\n- **Returning the result:** Finally, we return the list of beautiful indices, which is already sorted due to the nature of how we append and break in the loop.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find and check all potential beautiful indices.", "input_output": [{"input": "s = \"isawsquirrelnearmysquirrelhouseohmy\", a = \"my\", b = \"squirrel\", k = 15", "output": "[16,33]"}, {"input": "s = \"abcd\", a = \"a\", b = \"a\", k = 4", "output": "[0]"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3245, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given a 0-indexed string s, a string a, a string b, and an integer k.\nAn index i is beautiful if:\n\n0 <= i <= s.length - a.length\ns[i..(i + a.length - 1)] == a\nThere exists an index j such that:\n\t\n0 <= j <= s.length - b.length\ns[j..(j + b.length - 1)] == b\n|j - i| <= k\n\n\n\nReturn the array that contains beautiful indices in sorted order from smallest to largest.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"isawsquirrelnearmysquirrelhouseohmy\", a = \"my\", b = \"squirrel\", k = 15\nOutput: [16,33]\nExplanation: There are 2 beautiful indices: [16,33].\n- The index 16 is beautiful as s[16..17] == \"my\" and there exists an index 4 with s[4..11] == \"squirrel\" and |16 - 4| <= 15.\n- The index 33 is beautiful as s[33..34] == \"my\" and there exists an index 18 with s[18..25] == \"squirrel\" and |33 - 18| <= 15.\nThus we return [16,33] as the result.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abcd\", a = \"a\", b = \"a\", k = 4\nOutput: [0]\nExplanation: There is 1 beautiful index: [0].\n- The index 0 is beautiful as s[0..0] == \"a\" and there exists an index 0 with s[0..0] == \"a\" and |0 - 0| <= 4.\nThus we return [0] as the result.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= s.length <= 105\n1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10\ns, a, and b contain only lowercase English letters.\n\n", "lang_code": "class Solution:\n    def beautifulIndices(self, s: str, a: str, b: str, k: int) -> List[int]:"}}

This can be achieved by combining numbers that have fewer bits set to 1.\n   - We can use a greedy approach to iteratively combine numbers, starting from the least significant bit.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the bits from the least significant to the most significant.\n   - For each bit position, we will try to combine numbers in such a way that the resulting number has that bit set to 0 as much as possible.\n   - We will use a counter to keep track of how many operations we have used.\n\nHere's the implementation of the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def minOrAfterOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:\n        # Initialize the result with all bits set to 1\n        result = (1 << 31) - 1  # This is 2^31 - 1, assuming a 32-bit integer\n        \n        # Iterate over each bit position from 0 to 30 (0-indexed)\n        for bit in range(30, -1, -1):\n            # Create a mask for the current bit\n            mask = (1 << bit)\n            \n            # Count how many numbers have the current bit set to 1\n            count = 0\n            for num in nums:\n                if num & mask:\n                    count += 1\n            \n            # If more than k numbers have the current bit set to 1, we need to try to combine them\n            if count > k:\n                # Try to combine numbers to reduce the count of numbers with the current bit set\n                new_nums = []\n                i = 0\n                while i < len(nums) and k > 0:\n                    if nums[i] & mask:\n                        # Try to combine with the next number if it also has the bit set\n                        if i + 1 < len(nums) and nums[i + 1] & mask:\n                            new_nums.append(nums[i] & nums[i + 1])\n                            i += 2\n                            k -= 1\n                        else:\n                            new_nums.append(nums[i])\n                            i += 1\n                    else:\n                        new_nums.append(nums[i])\n                        i += 1\n                # If there are remaining numbers, add them to the new list\n                while i < len(nums):\n                    new_nums.append(nums[i])\n                    i += 1\n                nums = new_nums\n            \n            # Update the result by clearing the current bit if we can\n            if count <= k:\n                result &= ~mask\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over each bit position and tries to minimize the OR by combining numbers. The complexity is O(n * log(max(nums))), where n is the length of the array and log(max(nums)) is the number of bits in the largest number.

The houses are connected in a linear fashion with an additional direct connection between houses `x` and `y`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: We can represent the houses and streets as a graph. The houses are nodes, and the streets are edges. There is a direct edge between each pair of consecutive houses, and an additional edge between houses `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: To find the shortest path between any two houses, we can use BFS. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n3. **Counting Pairs**: For each house, we will perform a BFS to find the shortest distance to all other houses. We will count how many times each distance `k` appears across all BFS results.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle the case where `x` and `y` are the same, which means there is no additional direct connection.\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def countOfPairs(self, n: int, x: int, y: int) -> List[int]:\n        # Initialize the result array\n        result = [0] * n\n        \n        # Function to perform BFS and count distances\n        def bfs(start):\n            visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n            queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (current node, distance)\n            visited[start] = True\n            \n            while queue:\n                node, dist = queue.popleft()\n                if dist > 0:\n                    result[dist - 1] += 1  # Increment the count for this distance\n                \n                # Explore neighbors\n                neighbors = [node - 1, node + 1]\n                if node == x:\n                    neighbors.append(y)\n                if node == y:\n                    neighbors.append(x)\n                \n                for neighbor in neighbors:\n                    if 1 <= neighbor <= n and not visited[neighbor]:\n                        visited[neighbor] = True\n                        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))\n        \n        # Perform BFS from each house\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            bfs(i)\n        \n        return result\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **BFS Function**: The `bfs` function starts from a given house and explores all reachable houses using BFS. It keeps track of the distance from the start house to each other house.\n  \n- **Neighbors**: For each house, its neighbors are the houses directly connected by streets. Additionally, if the house is `x`, we also consider `y` as a neighbor, and vice versa.\n\n- **Distance Counting**: We maintain a `result` array where `result[k]` counts the number of pairs with a shortest path of `k + 1` streets. We update this array during each BFS traversal.\n\n- **Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we perform a BFS from each of the `n` houses, and each BFS takes O(n) time in the worst case.\n\nThis solution efficiently calculates the required distances and counts the pairs of houses for each distance.", "input_output": [{"input": "n = 3, x = 1, y = 3", "output": "[6,0,0]"}, {"input": "n = 5, x = 2, y = 4", "output": "[10,8,2,0,0]"}, {"input": "n = 4, x = 1, y = 1", "output": "[6,4,2,0]"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3271, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given three positive integers n, x, and y.\nIn a city, there exist houses numbered 1 to n connected by n streets.

This will store the final average intensities.\n   - We also create a `count` grid to keep track of how many regions each pixel belongs to.\n\n2. **Helper Function `is_valid_region`**:\n   - This function checks if a 3x3 subgrid starting at `(x, y)` is a valid region based on the threshold.\n   - It checks the absolute difference between adjacent pixels in both horizontal and vertical directions.\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible 3x3 Subgrids**:\n   - We iterate over all possible starting points `(i, j)` for 3x3 subgrids in the image.\n   - For each subgrid, we check if it is a valid region using `is_valid_region`.\n   - If it is valid, we calculate the average intensity of the subgrid and update the corresponding pixels in `result` and increment their count in `count`.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Result**:\n   - After processing all subgrids, we iterate over the `result` grid.\n   - For each pixel, if it belongs to any region (`count[i][j] > 0`), we compute the final average intensity by dividing the total intensity by the count.\n   - If a pixel does not belong to any region, we set it to its original intensity from the `image`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly compute the average intensity for each pixel based on the regions it belongs to, handling edge cases where a pixel does not belong to any region.", "input_output": [{"input": "image = [[5,6,7,10],[8,9,10,10],[11,12,13,10]], threshold = 3", "output": "[[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]]"}, {"input": "image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12", "output": "[[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]]"}, {"input": "image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1", "output": "[[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]]"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3272, "difficulty": "Medium", "question_title": "You are given m x n grid image which represents a grayscale image, where image[i][j] represents a pixel with intensity in the range [0..255]. You are also given a non-negative integer threshold.\nTwo pixels are adjacent if they share an edge.\nA region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold.\nAll pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions.\nYou need to calculate a m x n grid result, where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the regions to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] belongs to multiple regions, result[i][j] is the average of the rounded-down average intensities of these regions, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] does not belong to any region, result[i][j] is equal to image[i][j].\nReturn the grid result.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: image = [[5,6,7,10],[8,9,10,10],[11,12,13,10]], threshold = 3\nOutput: [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]]\nExplanation:\n\nThere are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9.\nPlease note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12\nOutput: [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]]\nExplanation:\n\nThere are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27.\nAll the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1\nOutput: [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]]\nExplanation:\nThere is only one 3 x 3 subgrid, while it does not have the condition on difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between image[0][0] and image[1][0] is |5 - 8| = 3 > threshold = 1. None of them belong to any valid regions, so the result should be the same as image.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n3 <= n, m <= 500\n0 <= image[i][j] <= 255\n0 <= threshold <= 255\n\n", "lang_code": "class Solution:\n    def resultGrid(self, image: List[List[int]], threshold: int) -> List[List[int]]:"}}

The operations involve removing the first `k` characters and appending any `k` characters to the end of the string at each second.\n\nThe key insight here is that we need to find the smallest period `T` such that after performing the operations `T` times, the string `word` returns to its original form. This means that the string `word` should be a concatenation of repeated substrings of length `k` in such a way that after `T` operations, the string aligns with its original form.\n\nTo achieve this, we can use the concept of the period of a string. The period of a string is the smallest positive integer `p` such that the string repeats every `p` characters.

The overlap in the x-dimension is the maximum of the left edges minus the minimum of the right edges. Similarly, the overlap in the y-dimension is the maximum of the bottom edges minus the minimum of the top edges.\n\n2. **Determine the Largest Square**: For the overlapping region, the side length of the largest square that can fit is the minimum of the overlapping x and y dimensions.

We then calculate the number of deletions required:\n   - If a frequency is greater than `max_freq`, we need to delete characters to reduce it to `max_freq`.\n   - If a frequency is less than `max_freq - k`, we need to delete all characters with this frequency since they cannot be adjusted to be within the acceptable range.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Maximum Frequencies**: We iterate over each frequency value as a potential `max_freq` and keep track of the minimum deletions required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string `k-special`.", "input_output": [{"input": "word = \"aabcaba\", k = 0", "output": "3"}, {"input": "word = \"dabdcbdcdcd\", k = 2", "output": "2"}, {"input": "word = \"aaabaaa\", k = 2", "output": "1"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3360, "difficulty": "Meidum", "question_title": "You are given a string word and an integer k.\nWe consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.\nHere, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.\nReturn the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: word = \"aabcaba\", k = 0\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of \"a\" and 1 occurrence of \"c\". Therefore, word becomes equal to \"baba\" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: word = \"dabdcbdcdcd\", k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of \"a\" and 1 occurrence of \"d\".

Each element in `nums` is a positive integer.\n2. The sequence is strictly increasing, i.e., `nums[i + 1] > nums[i]` for all `0 <= i < n - 1`.\n3. The bitwise AND of all elements in `nums` is `x`.\n\nGiven these constraints, the key observation is that for the bitwise AND of all elements to be `x`, each bit that is set in `x` must also be set in every element of `nums`. This is because the AND operation between any number and `x` will only keep the bits that are set in both numbers.\n\nTo minimize `nums[n - 1]`, we should start with the smallest possible numbers that satisfy the above condition. The smallest number that has all the bits set as in `x` is `x` itself. Therefore, we can start with `nums[0] = x`.\n\nThe next step is to ensure that the sequence is strictly increasing.

If not, we keep incrementing until it satisfies the condition.\n- Finally, we return `current`, which will be the `n`-th element in the sequence and the minimum possible value of `nums[n - 1]`.", "input_output": [{"input": "n = 3, x = 4", "output": "6"}, {"input": "n = 2, x = 7", "output": "15"}], "meta": {"question_id": 3394, "difficulty": "Meidum", "question_title": "You are given two integers n and x.
